# Note #1: the full list of Clang-Tidy checks can be found at
#          https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/list.html...
# Note #2: performance-no-automatic-move shouldn't be disabled, but we have to
#          due to an issue with Qt (see
#          https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-85415)...
# Note #3: readability-redundant-access-specifiers shouldn't normally be
#          disabled, but Clang-Tidy gets a bit confused with access specifiers
#          like "public" vs. "public slots"...

# Note: if you make changes here, you may need to make changes in .clang-tidy
# files elsewhere in the tree; clang-tidy-10 doesn't allow selective
# inheritance of parent .clang-tidy files.

# Note that the readability-identifier-naming check is disabled, there are too
# many violations in the codebase and they create too much noise in clang-tidy
# results.
# Naming settings are kept for documentation purposes and allowing to run the
# check if the users would override this file, e.g. via a command-line arg.
